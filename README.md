Fork of https://github.com/haxiomic/firefox-multi-touch-zoom

made (somewhat) compatible with Chrome, although it does have its own issues.

I don't plan to support and update this "port", feel free to use and improve it.

And Fork of [NayamAmarshe/firefox-multi-touch-zoom](https://github.com/NayamAmarshe/firefox-multi-touch-zoom)

made it manifest V3 compatible. So far no strange behavior.
